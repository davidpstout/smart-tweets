## AI: Revolutionizing the Obvious

- "AI will change the world." Because, of course, we thought it was developed to play vintage video games forever.
- "AI can learn and adapt." Unlike my houseplant, which has learned only how to die spectacularly.
- "AI will automate many jobs." In other news, water is wet.
- "AI is based on data." And here I was, thinking it ran on magic and wishful thinking.
- "The future of AI is limitless." Just like my ability to procrastinate.
- "AI raises ethical questions." It's almost as if creating a potentially sentient being should make us think twice.
- "AI can be used for good or evil." Much like a spoon.

## Why This README Exists
